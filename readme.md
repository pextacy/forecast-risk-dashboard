# Forecast & Risk Dashboard (Treasury ML)

## 📌 Overview
**Forecast & Risk Dashboard** is an AI-powered treasury management tool that helps businesses and funds forecast cashflows, measure volatility, and receive explainable hedging suggestions.  
Unlike black-box financial models, this project emphasizes **clarity, transparency, and real-world execution** — providing forecasts alongside plain-language AI narratives.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **30-Day Forecasts**
  - Time-series prediction of asset values, portfolio volatility, and cashflow risks.
  - Uses real statistical and ML methods (ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet).
- **One-Click Hedging Suggestions**
  - Example: *“Move 20% of high-volatility assets into stable holdings.”*
  - AI explains rationale in **simple financial language**.
- **Simulation & Backtesting**
  - Users can upload historical data to test model accuracy.
  - Simulated hedging actions on past datasets for performance validation.
- **Explainability First**
  - AI-generated rationale is tied to **measurable risk metrics** (VaR, Sharpe ratio, volatility bands).
  - Designed to build **trust** with treasury teams.

## 🚀 MVP Workflow
1. **Upload Data**
   - CSV/Excel with historical treasury data (cashflows, asset prices).
   - Pre-built connectors for **Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, CoinGecko** for real price feeds.
2. **Forecast**
   - Generate 30-day forecast chart (volatility, portfolio value).
   - Models: `statsmodels.ARIMA`, Facebook Prophet, or lightweight neural nets.
3. **AI Narrative**
   - Example:  
     *“Your portfolio is projected to experience a 15% volatility increase. Consider reallocating 25% of BTC holdings into stablecoins to reduce exposure.”*
4. **Hedge Simulation**
   - Execute simulated rebalancing.
   - Visualize impact on volatility and returns.
5. **Backtesting**
   - Evaluate accuracy using rolling-window historical testing.

  - `torch` (small LSTM models for sequence prediction)
- **Data Sources (Real APIs)**:
  - [Yahoo Finance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) (stocks, FX, indices)
  - [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) (global equities, FX, crypto)

## 📊 Example Forecast Output
- **Chart**: 30-day BTC price forecast with confidence intervals  
- **Metric**: Portfolio Value at Risk (95% confidence)  
- **Narrative**:  
  *“There is a 20% probability of your cash reserves dropping below $850k within the next 30 days. Allocating 10% of reserves to USD-backed assets can reduce this risk by 60%.”*

## ✅ Real-World Use Cases
- **Corporate Treasury** → Cashflow risk management  
- **Crypto Funds** → Stablecoin hedge strategies  
- **Family Offices / Asset Managers** → Volatility monitoring with plain explanations  
- **Fintech Integrations** → API-ready treasury AI forecasting

## 🔒 Risk & Limitations
- **Accuracy Limitations**:
  - Forecasts depend on market conditions; no “perfect predictions.”
  - Models may underperform during high volatility (e.g., black swan events).
- **Mitigation**:
  - Backtesting with rolling validation.
  - Stress testing on crisis data (e.g., 2008, 2020).
  - Explainability-first approach: always tie suggestions to risk metrics.

## 🛣️ Roadmap
### Phase 1 (MVP - 2 months)
- CSV upload + forecast (ARIMA, Prophet).  
- Interactive chart + AI narrative generation.  
- Simple “hedge suggestion” engine.

### Phase 2 (Scaling - 4 months)
- Live API integrations (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, CoinGecko).  
- Portfolio-wide hedging simulations.  
- Backtesting dashboard with rolling metrics.

### Phase 3 (Enterprise - 6+ months)
- Risk-adjusted optimization (e.g., mean-variance, CVaR).  
- Multi-user/team collaboration features.  
- Compliance-friendly audit logs.
